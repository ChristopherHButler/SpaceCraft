# Tasks To Do

- Run linter / syntax checker.
- Check how Yjs websocket server and Socket.io websocket server integrate (ie, are the different versions compatible?).
- Refactor how 'ruby' is hardcoded into many different places.
- Specify node version in `package.json` and/or another file (if beneficial).
- Go through files and copy `@todo` comments to here or to the GitHub Project page.
